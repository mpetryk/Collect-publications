Sensor networks are connected to the Internet via these gateways based on various transmission protocols. In particular, the main features of IOT gateways are reliability, high real-time, security and so on. This paper proposes a heterogeneous IOT gateway based on dynamic priority scheduling algorithm. This gateway realizes data conversion and transformation between the Internet and sensor networks as well as several kinds of communication protocol: RS485, Bluetooth, CAN, Zigbee and GSM. To ensure the data security and reliability for IOT gateway, some higher-level protocols are designed and implemented on the gateway. A dynamic priority scheduling algorithm of a real-time system is also used in the gateway to address the problem of data concurrency and improve real-time performance by efficiently scheduling tasks. Simulation results reveal that the gateway realizes the data transmission between sensor networks and the Internet using specific higher-level protocols and response within a very short delay, achieving the goal of addressing the problem of data concurrency.\\n', 'SN  - 0142-3312\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/0142331214527600\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/0142331214527600\\n']\n",

Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures.\\n', 'SN  - 2472-6303\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/2472630318769454\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/2472630318769454\\n']\n",

The future of the interactive world depends on the future Internet of Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm in the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them, and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it, and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere. A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing analysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to the IoT network.\\n', 'SN  - 1550-1477\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/1550147716657926\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147716657926\\n']\n",

Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests.

We hope this is useful for anyone considering a foresight analysis task, an approach we present as an innovative and rigorous tool for assessing and understanding the future of a field. Second, we present findings from our analysis of pivotal transformations in the field and the future scenarios we constructed for audiences, as media technologies rapidly change with the arrival of the Internet of Things and changes on many levels occur in audience practices.

With cloud computing, medical sensor and actuator data can be stored and analyzed remotely by distributed servers. The results can then be delivered via the Internet. The number of devices in IoT includes such wireless diabetes devices as blood glucose monitors, continuous glucose monitors, insulin pens, insulin pumps, and closed-loop systems. The cloud model for data storage and analysis is increasingly unable to process the data avalanche, and processing is being pushed out to the edge of the network closer to where the data-generating devices are. Fog computing and edge computing are two architectures for data handling that can offload data from the cloud, process it nearby the patient, and transmit information machine-to-machine or machine-to-human in milliseconds or seconds. Sensor data can be processed near the sensing and actuating devices with fog computing (with local nodes) and with edge computing (within the sensing devices). Compared to cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing offer five advantages: (1) greater data transmission speed, (2) less dependence on limited bandwidths, (3) greater privacy and security, (4) greater control over data generated in foreign countries where laws may limit use or permit unwanted governmental access, and (5) lower costs because more sensor-derived data are used locally and less data are transmitted remotely. Connected diabetes devices almost all use fog computing or edge computing because diabetes patients require a very rapid response to sensor input and cannot tolerate delays for cloud computing.\\n', 'SN  - 1932-2968\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/1932296817717007\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296817717007\\n']\n",

In this article, we propose an intelligent and reliable standby power management system. The system uses physical and virtual user behavioral pattern analysis based on energy-aware management to cut-off the standby power of office appliances in the office environment. We propose a two-step priority power-aware method. The first step entails physical perception and management that controls devices through user recognition and device relationship scenarios. The second step is virtual perception and management that controls the standby power by collecting user behavioral patterns and performs an analysis based on a rule mechanism. The proposed system was applied to three locations (offices A, B, and C) in the university test-bed. Power consumption was reduced to 23% of the original consumption through the elimination of unnecessary standby power consumption.\\n', 'SN  - 1550-1477\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/1550147716673931\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147716673931\\n']\n",

However, the new paradigm, as inspired by the idea that smart objects will soon have a certain degree of social consciousness, is still in its infant state for several reasons. Most of the related works are far from embracing the social aspects of smart objects and the dynamicity of inter-object social relations. Furthermore, there is yet to be a coherent structure for organising and managing IoT objects that elicit social-like features. To fully understand how and to what extent these objects mimic the behaviours of humans, we first model SIoT by scrutinising the distinct characteristics and structural facets of human-centric social networks. To elaborate, we describe the process of profiling the IoT objects that become social and classify various inter-object social relationships. Afterwards, a novel discovery mechanism, which utilises our hypergraph-based overlay network model, is proposed. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have performed several experiments on our smart home automation demo box built with various sensors and actuators.\\n', 'SN  - 0165-5515\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/0165551516674164\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551516674164\\n']\n",

Though the concept of QoL has been in existence since decades in association with human lifestyle, it has now crept into every urban citizen?s life. QoL is multidimensional and depends on the level of basic need fulfilment, security requirements, socialization and psychosocial factors. Moreover, QoL is both an individual and collective attribute. Besides, for ensuring QoL in cities, a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies need to be deployed. This article articulates that in these days, QoL can be met in the upcoming Smart Cities, and substantiates it with reporting the QoL practices in Palava Smart City (Mumbai). Since ?Smart Cities? is a new notion, an exploratory study has been conducted. The primary data collection techniques are surveys, in-depth interviews and observation. In addition, data have been gathered from secondary sources including various published articles, corporate white papers, blogs and videos. The data analysis has been carried out by SPSS and Atlas-ti software. Palava City Management Association (PCMA) has been planning and implementing high-tech infrastructure, socialization amenities, healthcare benefits, citizen security and embedding IoT technologies for ensuring round-the-clock operational efficiency in the city premises.

Based on 762 IoT business cases (2008?2012), this study explored the technology attributes and business contexts of IoT usage and identified five representative value configuration models of IoT through cluster analysis: ID-based service model, Multiple operation management model, Service-combined inventory management model, Intelligent inventory transport model, and Sensor-based multiple service model. In addition, propositions for IoT utilization in each industry were provided according to the five value configuration models. The research results provide a holistic view for understanding IoT utilization in various business areas and the value configuration framework approach provides a more elaborate frame to understand diffusion trends of new technology.\\n', 'SN  - 0266-6669\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/0266666915578201\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/0266666915578201\\n']\n",

Production events enabled real-time production control system is good at responsibility and flexibility. Internet of things (IoT) can provide enormous real-time production events, which represent the change of material flows. However, some of production events seriously interfere with production control procedures. They sharply restrict the real-time capability of production control system. Thus, it is imperative that an efficient realization method of production control system, which is enabled by useful production events. Additionally, the control system should satisfy production control procedures visibility. For solving the problems, a production events graphical deduction model enabled real-time production control system for smart job shop is proposed in this article. Firstly, the manufacturing resources are divided into work in process related, operator-related, cutting tool-related, fixture tool-related, and measuring tool-related. And the material flows of different manufacturing resources in IoT-enabled smart job shop are described in detail. Secondly, the graphical deduction model of production event is put forward. Based on the model, the material flows of manufacturing resources in a process are segmented into several stages according to different production events. And then, the cooperation model of manufacturing resources is established by using the time and logical relationships between production events. Thirdly, the control model in a process is drawn from the cooperation model. Next, the entire control procedure of work in process production in IoT-enabled smart job shop is proposed. Finally, a small-scale IoT-enabled manufacturing system is used to verify the feasibility of the proposed model and methods.\\n', 'SN  - 0954-4062\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/0954406217728531\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/0954406217728531\\n']\n",

However, looking through encrypted data is difficult. A number of techniques for searching encrypted data have been devised. However, certain security solutions may not be used in smart devices in IoT-cloud because such solutions are not lightweight. In this article, we present a lightweight scheme that can enable a content-based search through encrypted images. In particular, images are represented using local features. We develop and validate a secure scheme for measuring the Euclidean distance between two feature vectors. In addition, we use a hashing method, namely, locality-sensitive hashing, to devise the searchable index. The use of an locality-sensitive hashing index increases the proficiency and effectiveness of a system, thereby allowing the retrieval of only relevant images with a minimum number of distance evaluations. Refining vector techniques are used to refine relevant results efficiently and securely. Our index construction process ensures that stored data and trapdoors are kept private. Our system also efficiently supports multi-user authentication by avoiding the expensive traditional method, which enables data owners to define who can search for a specific image. Compared with other similarity-based encryption methods predicated upon searchability, the option presented in this study offers superior search speed and storage efficiency.\\n', 'SN  - 1550-1477\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/1550147718761814\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147718761814\\n']\n",

No longer just a buzz term, it?ll continue to grow at an unprecedented pace over the next few years expecting to reach over 25 billion connected devices by 2020. History shows us that most fast growth technology solutions focus on solving business problems first and security is an afterthought. Unfortunately, IoT is following the same trend. Most IoT devices, apps, and infrastructure were developed without security in mind and are likely going to become targets of hackers. According to some security experts, major cyberattacks against the IoT devices are looming. According to the FBI, criminals can gain access to unprotected devices used in home health care, such as those used to collect and transmit personal monitoring data or time-dispensed medicines. Once criminals have breached such devices, they gain access to any personal or medical information stored on the devices, as well as the power to change the coding that controls the dispense mechanism of medicines or health data collection. This can result in major health issues and potential loss of lives. Are organizations ready to protect themselves? What are the key vulnerable points? There are various steps that companies can take to raise the barrier.

With the rise of the Internet of medical things (IoMT), along with smart devices, the med-tech industry is on the cusp of a home-care revolution, which could also create opportunity for developing effective solutions with significant potential to reduce DFU-associated costs and saving limbs. This article discusses potential applications of IoMT to the DFU patient population and beyond.Methods:To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with implementing IoMT for management of DFU, the authors reviewed recent relevant literatures and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including podiatry, engineering, and data security.Results:The IoMT has opened digital transformation of home-based diabetic foot care, as it enables promoting patient engagement, personalized care and smart management of chronic and noncommunicable diseases through individual data-driven treatment regimens, telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback tailored to individual requirements. In particular, with recent advances in voice-activated commands technology and its integration as a part of IoMT, new opportunities have emerged to improve the patient?s central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized health care ecosystem.Conclusions:The IoMT has opened new opportunities in health care from remote monitoring to smart sensors and medical device integration. While it is at its early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home that, using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, may augment much of what home health does today.\\n', 'SN  - 1932-2968\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1177/1932296818768618\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296818768618\\n']\n",
