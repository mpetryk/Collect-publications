The supply chains that support online retailing are fundamentally different from those that support traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Traditional solutions are not always appropriate to solve online retailing?s operations problems; thus, there is an opportunity to understand and improve these novel supply chains. One key characteristic of the inventory systems for online retailing is demand spillover, whereby a stockout at a fulfillment center (FC) results in demand spilling over to another FC. For this context we examine how to allocate inventory to the FCs under a periodic-review joint-replenishment policy, with an objective to minimize outbound shipping costs for a fixed amount of inventory. We first show how traditional decentralized allocation policies may perform suboptimally and induce dynamics (whiplash) that result in costly spillover. We find that this phenomenon increases with the prevalence of local stockouts and with the level of inventory imbalance. We then describe that inventory imbalance occurs in online retailing because of operational realities and provide evidence based on real data. Finally, we propose a heuristic to allocate inventory accounting for possible spillover during the lead time. We test the heuristic by a simulation and show that it performs better than the status quo policy, is robust to operational realities, and captures over 90% of the possible improvement as compared to a pseudo-optimal policy. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2016.0614.\\n', 'AB  - Online purchases constitute about one-tenth of U.S. retail sales. The supply chains that support online retailing are fundamentally different from those that support traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Traditional solutions are not always appropriate to solve online retailing?s operations problems; thus, there is an opportunity to understand and improve these novel supply chains. One key characteristic of the inventory systems for online retailing is demand spillover, whereby a stockout at a fulfillment center (FC) results in demand spilling over to another FC. For this context we examine how to allocate inventory to the FCs under a periodic-review joint-replenishment policy, with an objective to minimize outbound shipping costs for a fixed amount of inventory. We first show how traditional decentralized allocation policies may perform suboptimally and induce dynamics (whiplash) that result in costly spillover. We find that this phenomenon increases with the prevalence of local stockouts and with the level of inventory imbalance. We then describe that inventory imbalance occurs in online retailing because of operational realities and provide evidence based on real data. Finally, we propose a heuristic to allocate inventory accounting for possible spillover during the lead time. We test the heuristic by a simulation and show that it performs better than the status quo policy, is robust to operational realities, and captures over 90% of the possible improvement as compared to a pseudo-optimal policy.

The telecom provider randomly sent targeted mobile ads to individual users, measured purchase rates, and surveyed purchasers and nonpurchasers. Based on a sample of 14,972 mobile phone users, the results suggest that, counterintuitively, commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond to a mobile offer by making a purchase vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis those in noncrowded trains.

The effects are robust to exploiting sudden variations in crowdedness induced by unanticipated train delays underground and street closures aboveground. Follow-up surveys provide insights into the causal mechanism driving this result. A plausible explanation is mobile immersion: As increased crowding invades one?s physical space, people adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads.

As mobile technologies can reach users anywhere and anytime, LMP becomes a promising new channel. We unravel the dynamic sales impact of LMP on the basis of a randomized field experiment with 22,000 mobile users sponsored by one of the largest mobile service providers in the world. Our identification strategy is to gauge the marginal increases in consumer purchases of the geo-fenced treatment group of users who received LMP, above and beyond the baseline control groups. There are two controls: one group who received the same LMP but not in the virtual geo-fencing locational range (nongeo-fenced control), and the other who did not receive the LMP but in the geo-fencing range (geo-fenced control). The latter control serves as an organic holdout baseline from the similar population, i.e., counterfactual test of what if without the mobile LMP intervention, to identify the actual ?lift? of incremental purchases caused by the treatment with the mobile LMP intervention. Findings suggest that LMP treatment has a significantly stronger impact on contemporaneous (same-day) purchases and delayed (subsequent-days) purchases than the controls. The randomized experiment design renders these findings robust to alternative explanations such as mobile usage behavior heterogeneity, product effects heterogeneity, nonrandomized sample-selection bias, and endogeneity concerns. Follow-up surveys with the field experiment users explore the nuanced mechanisms via which LMP may induce the impulsive, same-day purchases, and create product awareness for the planned subsequent-days purchases. LMP can generate six times more purchases than nongeo-fenced control with the LMP intervention, and 12 times more than geo-fenced control without the LMP intervention. LMP has a delayed sales effect for 12 days after the mobile promotions. The total sales impact of LMP could be underestimated by 54% if excluding the delayed sales impact and only including the contemporaneous impact. These findings are new to the literature and often neglected in mobile promotion practices, proffering novel implications on the sales value of LMP in the mobile era.\\n', 'AB  - Can location-based mobile promotion (LMP) trigger contemporaneous and delayed sales purchases?

LMP can generate six times more purchases than nongeo-fenced control with the LMP intervention, and 12 times more than geo-fenced control without the LMP intervention. LMP has a delayed sales effect for 12 days after the mobile promotions. The total sales impact of LMP could be underestimated by 54% if excluding the delayed sales impact and only including the contemporaneous impact. These findings are new to the literature and often neglected in mobile promotion practices, proffering novel implications on the sales value of LMP in the mobile era.\\n', 'SN  - 1047-7047\\n', 'M3  - doi: 10.1287/isre.2015.0586\\n', 'UR  - https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2015.0586\\n']\n",

We examine three job moves: (a) turnover to another IT job in a different firm, (b) turnaway-within to a non-IT job, and (c) turnaway-between to a different firm and a non-IT job. We analyze work histories spanning 28 years for 359 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We report three major findings. First, as hypothesized, larger relative pay gaps significantly increase the likelihood of job mobility. Second, IT males and IT females have different job mobility patterns. IT males are more likely to turn over than turn away-between when faced with a relative pay gap. Further, and contrary to predictions from human capital theory, IT males are more likely to turn away-within than turn over. This surprising finding suggests that the ubiquitous use of IT in other business functions may have increased the value of IT skills for non-IT jobs and reduced the friction of moving from IT to other non-IT positions. Third, and consistent with stigmatization arguments, IT females are more likely to turn away from IT than to turn over when faced with a relative pay gap. In fact, to reduce relative pay gaps, IT females tend to take on lower-status jobs that pay less than their IT jobs. We conclude this study with important theoretical, practical, and policy implications.\\n', 'AB  - This study draws on distributive justice, human capital, and stigmatization theories to hypothesize relationships between relative pay gap and patterns of job mobility.

The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers? signals are available to all parties. Under this circumstance, the supplier will profit from information flow and the retailers can earn profit gains as well, whereas the consumers will be worse off.\\n', 'AB  - We investigate information flow in two-tier supply chains, where retailers order from suppliers and sell in a market with uncertain demand. The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition.

Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. A consumer who purchased a firm?s product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm?s profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers? sharing of products with high marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers, whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a lose-lose situation.

Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. A consumer who purchased a firm?s product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm?s profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers? sharing of products with high marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers, whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a lose-lose situation. Furthermore, in the presence of the sharing market, the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality, leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.

(p. 771) Anat Bracha, Chaim Fershtman Can we design work incentives to spur employees to work both harder and smarter? Almost all jobs require a combination of cognitive effort and labor effort. The authors examine the effect that incentive schemes have on the chosen combination of cognitive and labor effort. They show that competitive incentives may induce agents to work harder but not necessarily smarter. The insight for management: It is difficult to think under pressure, and therefore competitive pressure has a negative impact on cognitive effort but a positive impact on labor effort. Analyzing Screening Policies for Childhood Obesity (p. 782) Yan Yang, Jeremy D. Goldhaber-Fiebert, Lawrence M. Wein What can be done about obesity? Because of the health and economic costs of childhood obesity, coupled with studies suggesting the benefits of comprehensive intervention (dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral counseling), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended childhood screening and intervention for obesity beginning at age 6. The authors use a data set consisting of the body mass index of children up to age 18 and another data set containing the body mass index at ages 18 and 40 with the presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes to formulate the optimal biennial obesity screening thresholds from a societal viewpoint. The insight for management: Adult hypertension and diabetes can be minimized by focusing childhood obesity screening and treatment on older adolescents, but the optimal childhood obesity screening policies are as yet unclear. Class-Restricted Clustering and Microperturbation for Data Privacy (p. 796) Xiao-Bai Li, Sumit Sarkar How can businesses leverage the plethora of data now available without threatening the privacy of their customers? The extensive use of information technologies by organizations to collect and share personal data has raised strong privacy concerns. For example, AOL drew fire for releasing 20 million search queries to the public, and Netflix had to cancel the second round of its movie recommendation competition because its customers were concerned about their privacy and being ?reidentified??that is, individually identified even though the personal information was stripped. The authors propose a method of clustering data so that data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. They also propose a ?microperturbation? method for masking data that overcomes other clustering methods' inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. The insight for management: It is possible to distribute and gain insights from data without threatening the privacy of those who generated it by masking private details without reducing the information that can be gleaned from it. Managing Strategic Inventories via Manufacturer-to-Consumer Rebates (p. 813) Anil Arya, Brian Mittendorf Do you clip coupons? In 2011, coupons alone accounted for $4.6 billion in consumer redemptions, and it is estimated that other postpurchase rebates have soared to $8 billion annually. Manufacturer-to-consumer rebates are a staple of modern supply chains. Such rebates are typically viewed as a means of price discrimination because of partial redemption by consumers. However, the proliferation of universally redeemed instant rebates suggests that the practice may be motivated by additional considerations. The authors suggest that consumer rebates can be particularly useful when a supply chain shows inefficiencies from retailers holding excess inventory to convey a lower willingness to pay in the future to undercut future wholesale prices. As a retaliatory consequence, the manufacturer sets high near-term wholesale prices. The ?pull? promotion from consumer rebates encourages more timely retail sales and in doing so undercuts (but does not eliminate) the retailer's strategic inventories. Surprisingly, the authors find that the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers alike all benefit from the use of rebates, despite the fact that the manufacturer uses the rebates in self-interest and as a strategic weapon. The insight for management: The introduction of consumer rebates can serve as an enticement for retailers to sell, not just for consumers to buy. Overcoming Resistance to Organizational Change: Strong Ties and Affective Cooptation (p. 819) Julie Battilana, Tiziana Casciaro Keep your friends close and your enemies closer! The authors develop a theory of how members of an organization use the strength of ties in their network to overcome resistance to change. The authors propose that potentially influential ?fence sitters? can be affected by strong ties to change agents. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. However, ties to influential organization resistors to change work only for small changes. With bigger changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors are weaker and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption. The insight for management: Team with resistors to stop a leak but not a tidal wave; team with change agents to create one. Knowledge Recombination Across Technological Boundaries: Scientists vs. Engineers (p. 837) Marc Gruber, Dietmar Harhoff, Karin Hoisl How do individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of their recombination of different technologies to generate radical innovations? This ability has been viewed as the ?holy grail? of innovation research for a century. The authors reviewed 30,550 European patents from 1,880 inventors and found that inventors with a scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span technological boundaries than those with an engineering degree, but a doctoral degree is associated with increased recombination breadth. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations diminishes with time since his formal education, but the differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. The insight for management: Broader and deeper education of inventors leads to broader creativity and recombination of ideas than a narrower engineering degree. Momentum and Organizational Risk Taking: Evidence from the National Football League (p. 852) David W. Lehman, Jungpil Hahn Does going for it on fourth down build momentum, or is the risk unwarranted? The authors reviewed 22,603 play-by-play decisions made by the 32 teams of the National Football League during the 2000?2005 regular season games. They evaluate how such risks affect slack (resources in excess of current performance), aspirations (based on past performance or on the performance of other organizations), and survival. Most importantly, such risk-taking behaviors seem to be affected by momentum. The insight for management: Risk taking builds on itself; better forecasts of future firm behaviors might be achieved by taking momentum into account. Multistage Capital Budgeting with Delayed Consumption of Slack (p. 869) Stanley Baiman, Mirko S. Heinle, Richard Saouma How can a firm's capital budgeting policies balance investment efficiency against managers' consumption of perquisites? To limit the opportunities for managers to divert capital funds for private benefit, firms use their managerial accounting systems and audits of their capital projects. For example, these systems can easily uncover, and thereby preclude, the manager's diversion of capital funds from appropriate investments to private uses such as vacations or excess compensation. However, it is more difficult for these systems to distinguish between investments in necessary and unnecessary assets, provided that both fall within the general class of appropriate purchases. For instance, it may be difficult to detect that a manager is engaging in empire building (acquiring unnecessary hard assets such as research equipment, cars, or offices, or unnecessary soft assets such as staff and consulting services) from which he derives private benefits. Thus, at best the firm's accounting and auditing systems may mitigate a manager's misuse by constraining the set of assets into which he can divert capital funds for private benefit. For example, the private benefit of lavish offices is consumed over the time that the manager actually uses these offices (as compared to excess compensation or vacations, whose benefits are consumed immediately). The insight for management: Restricting investment to specific asset classes can reduce the private benefit to the manager to those consumed over time. Failure and Rescue in an Interbank Network (p. 882) L. C. G. Rogers, L. A. M. Veraart How do interbank obligations affect the fragility of our financial system? Over the last 10 or so years, there has been a growth of interest in the general phenomenon of the spread of bank failure through a network of interbank obligations. As the Asian banking crisis of the late 1990s and the more recent banking crisis of 2007?2008 have shown, the banking system generally can be very vulnerable to deterioration of assets, loss of liquidity, and loss of confidence. The authors study systemic risk in an interbank market, modeled as a directed graph of interbank obligations. The authors are able to analyze how failing banks might be rescued by consortia of other banks, establishing the important results that any consortium that has an incentive to rescue the failing banks also has the means and that any consortium of banks that would fail if default were allowed to spread would have an incentive to rescue if it had the means. The insight for management: Modeling may allow for reduced risks in and improved rescue mechanisms for our financial system. Add-on Pricing by Asymmetric Firms (p. 899) Jeffrey D. Shulman, Xianjun Geng What is the effect of add-on pricing on profitability and customer satisfaction? Consumers are often faced with fees for add-ons not included in the price of a base product (or service). For example, hotel guests, after room rates are already paid, often have to pay additional charges for services such as Internet access, parking, and use of a safe, a fitness center, and a pool. Banks charge fees for consumers who opt to cancel a check, use a foreign ATM, or use a debit card. Air travelers frequently find themselves paying for pet transport, snacks, checked luggage, and even blankets. Cell phone service providers charge subscribers to send text messages and download data. The authors examine the consequences of add-on pricing with consumers who are unaware of the add-on fees at the time of initial purchase. As it turns out, who benefits depends on the knowledge of the quality of the base product and the add-on items. The insight for management: Before a firm engages in add-on pricing strategies, it should evaluate the quality of base and add-on products. Publicizing Performance (p. 918) G\\xc3\\xbcnter Strobl, Edward D. Van Wesep Why not hide employee success from competitors to reduce poaching? Firms often do not attempt to keep their best employees hidden. Indeed, they often do just the opposite, by giving good employees impressive-sounding job titles and awards and, if asked, providing good letters of recommendation. This behavior is puzzling, because it makes it easier for competitors to poach a firm's best employees. As it turns out, firms that establish reputations for hiring young workers and promoting those who succeed lose good workers to competitors but can pay less to young, inexperienced workers in exchange. The authors find that firms with reputations for publicizing performance are able to pay less to employees at every level of tenure and thus earn economic profit but that these firms will never be the most productive in the economy. The insight for management: Public celebration of employee success may risk poaching and higher turnover, but the in-kind payment may also allow for the firm to pay lower employee wages. First-Party Content and Coordination in Two-Sided Markets (p. 933) Andrei Hagiu, Daniel Spulber Bill Gates said, ?Content is king.? This statement rings true because many firms use content as in-kind payments to attract customers. But how should this content be coordinated? The software, Internet, and mobile communications revolutions have created information distribution systems of unprecedented efficiency and vast markets for content (e.g., news, entertainment, data, software applications, games, articles, books, music, images, and video). Examples of platforms supplying first-party content include the following: e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon) provide customer ratings, search engines (e.g., Google) provide search results (website links), social networks (e.g., Facebook) provide network information (friend suggestions), and the like. The authors find that the strategic use of first-party content by two-sided platforms is driven by two key factors: the nature of buyer and seller expectations (favorable versus unfavorable) and the nature of the relationship between first-party content and third-party content (complements or substitutes). The insight for management: Coordinating first- and third-party content depends on the market for such products and the complementarity of first- and third-party products. Industry or Academia, Basic or Applied? Career Choices and Earnings Trajectories of Scientists (p. 950) Rajshree Agarwal, Atsushi Ohyama They say, ?Different strokes for different folks,? but what factors drive career choices and earnings trajectories? Many studies have looked at earnings potential of different career choices, but few have looked at the individual factors that contribute to career choice and the resulting self-sorting and earnings evolution. The authors link differences in physical capital investments and complementarities between basic and applied scientists across industry and academic settings to individual differences in scientist ability and preferences to predict an equilibrium matching of scientists to careers and to their earnings evolution. The study, based on the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System database, finds two results. First, there is a sorting by ability into basic versus applied science among academic scientists, but not among industry scientists. Second, there is a sorting by higher taste for nonmonetary returns into academia over industry. The evolution of an earnings profile is consistent with these sorting patterns: The earnings trajectories of basic and applied scientists are distinct from each other in academia but are similar in industry. The insight for management: There is a natural sorting by individual preference into theoretical and applied sciences and into industry and academia that drives earnings trajectories. Competitive Price-Matching Guarantees: Equilibrium Analysis of the Availability Verification Clause Under Demand Uncertainty (p. 971) Arcan Nalca, Tamer Boyaci, Saibal Ray, Many advertisers claim, ?No lower prices, anywhere!? But what value is the claim if the shopper has the onus of proving the claim wrong? Price-matching guarantees involve a retailer matching the lower price of a competitor for an identical product. In reality, retailers often make such guarantees contingent on the verification of product availability at the competitor's location and decline a price-match request if the product is not available there. This creates certain consternation on the part of customers. The authors show that availability contingency clauses intensify inventory competition between retailers and reinstitute price competition, which is otherwise eliminated by unconditional price-matching guarantees. Consequently, despite what customers may think about the availability verification, it actually makes them better off. On the other hand, such a clause reduces profits and, hence, is not an ideal strategy for retailers. The insight for management: Availability contingency clauses on price guarantees sound like a safeguard for retailers, but, in fact, they reduce prices and increase inventory availability competition, making retailers worse off and consumers better off. Mechanism Design for Capacity Planning Under Dynamic Evolutions of Asymmetric Demand Forecasts (p. 987) Sechan Oh, \\xc3\\x96zalp \\xc3\\x96zer Should a supplier build its capacity to meet manufacturer forecasts? Forecast information sharing has been touted as a great value toward increasing the efficiency of supply chains. But these forecasts must be accurate and unbiased to be useful. The authors consider a supplier's problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. The insight for management: This paper shows the supplier (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism.\\n\", \"AB  - Competitive Incentives: Working Harder or Working Smarter? (p. 771) Anat Bracha, Chaim Fershtman Can we design work incentives to spur employees to work both harder and smarter? Almost all jobs require a combination of cognitive effort and labor effort. The authors examine the effect that incentive schemes have on the chosen combination of cognitive and labor effort. They show that competitive incentives may induce agents to work harder but not necessarily smarter. The insight for management: It is difficult to think under pressure, and therefore competitive pressure has a negative impact on cognitive effort but a positive impact on labor effort. Analyzing Screening Policies for Childhood Obesity (p. 782) Yan Yang, Jeremy D. Goldhaber-Fiebert, Lawrence M. Wein What can be done about obesity? Because of the health and economic costs of childhood obesity, coupled with studies suggesting the benefits of comprehensive intervention (dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral counseling), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended childhood screening and intervention for obesity beginning at age 6. The authors use a data set consisting of the body mass index of children up to age 18 and another data set containing the body mass index at ages 18 and 40 with the presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes to formulate the optimal biennial obesity screening thresholds from a societal viewpoint. The insight for management: Adult hypertension and diabetes can be minimized by focusing childhood obesity screening and treatment on older adolescents, but the optimal childhood obesity screening policies are as yet unclear. Class-Restricted Clustering and Microperturbation for Data Privacy (p. 796) Xiao-Bai Li, Sumit Sarkar How can businesses leverage the plethora of data now available without threatening the privacy of their customers? The extensive use of information technologies by organizations to collect and share personal data has raised strong privacy concerns. For example, AOL drew fire for releasing 20 million search queries to the public, and Netflix had to cancel the second round of its movie recommendation competition because its customers were concerned about their privacy and being ?reidentified??that is, individually identified even though the personal information was stripped. The authors propose a method of clustering data so that data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are well distributed. They also propose a ?microperturbation? method for masking data that overcomes other clustering methods' inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes.

The study also analyzes the mediating effect of customer satisfaction on repurchase intention. The results of empirical analysis confirmed that website quality can be conceptualized as a composite of navigation, ease of understanding, information usefulness, website design, ease of use, security and privacy, ease of ordering, and customization. Second, website quality positively affects repurchase intention and customer satisfaction. Third, website service quality can affect repurchase intention by enhancing mediators like customer satisfaction, as it has full mediating effect on repurchase intention.

We also find that, under limited capacity, the downstream buyer may order the supplier?s entire capacity and strategically withhold some supply from being sold to the market even if there is no underlying supply-side or demand-side uncertainty.
